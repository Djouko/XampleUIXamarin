### Note

As I cut the icons and images on my own, so the value of margin or padding in the same row or column might not be consistent.

And the list page items have different size, no idea about how to implement it into an infinite list (tried to make an uneven list before though).

According to the license, the font files are not uploaded on Git.



### Thoughts

When reviewing the development, reliased that cutting images really took a lot of time. And finally got the hang of comparing UI efficiently in the last half an hour, which is to pin a screenshot and change opacity to compare. And first time tried to edit a video, and found that was the moment I realized I need a better CPU.
